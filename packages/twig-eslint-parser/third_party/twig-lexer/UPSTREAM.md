## Description

twig-lexer is a TypeScript port of Twig's PHP lexer (Twig 2.x era). It is
lossless: every character of a template ends up in exactly one token, which is
what lets this package map tokens back to exact source ranges.

It is forked rather than depended on because upstream has not been released
since April 2024 and lags behind Twig 3.x syntax that Drupal 10/11 templates
can use. Every difference from upstream is a patch file in this directory.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `pristine/` | Upstream files, byte for byte, from the revision above. Never edited. |
| `patches/series` | The order in which patches are applied. |
| `patches/TL-NN-*.patch` | One patch per concern, each with a [DEP-3](https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep3/) header. |
| `LICENSE` | Upstream's licence, unchanged. |
| `../../src/lexer/` | The shipped lexer: `pristine/src/main/lib/{Lexer,SyntaxError,Token,TokenType}.ts` with every patch applied. Generated, committed, and checked by `npm run vendor:check`. |

Patch headers use the DEP-3 fields `Description`, `Author`, `Origin`,
`Forwarded` and `Last-Update`, plus two project fields: `Twig-Reference`
(the Twig release or commit whose behaviour the patch reproduces) and `Test`
(what proves it).

## Files not shipped

- `TokenStream.ts`: a token stream and AST visitor this package does not use.
  It builds functions with `new Function`, which is unwanted in an ESLint
  parser. It stays in `pristine/` because upstream's `index.ts` and tests
  import it.
- `index.ts`: upstream's barrel file. This package imports the lexer files
  directly.
- Upstream tests (`pristine/src/test`): not shipped, but run against the
  patched sources by `npm run test:upstream` to prove patches do not break
  upstream behaviour. The TokenStream tests are not vendored.

## Build settings

`src/lexer` is compiled as its own TypeScript project (`tsconfig.lexer.json`)
with upstream's own strictness (`noImplicitAny` only). Compiling it under this
package's `strict` settings reports 66 findings (possibly-null regex matches,
uninitialised fields) that are not bugs; fixing them would add cosmetic
patches that hide the meaningful ones. The rest of the package is compiled
with `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.

## Local modifications

| ID | Change | Why | Twig reference | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TL-01 | Add `.js` extensions to relative imports | Shipped as native ES modules, where Node requires full specifiers | None (port fix) | `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:upstream` |
| TL-02 | Lex `# comment` inside expressions as `INLINE_COMMENT` (level 3) | Upstream throws "Unexpected character #" | Twig 3.15.0 | `comments.twig` parity |
| TL-03 | Add operators `<=>` (all levels) and `has some`, `has every`, `xor`, `?:`, `===`, `!==`, `?.` (level 3) | Upstream splits `===`/`?.` and reads word operators as names | Twig 2.12.0, 3.5.0, 3.15.0, 3.17.0, 3.23.0 | `operators.twig`, `tags.twig` parity |
| TL-04 | Word operators may be followed by `(`, `)`, `[` or `{` (level 3) | Upstream only allows whitespace or `(`, so `a or[b]` lexed `or` as a name | Twig 3.1.0 | `operators.twig` parity |
| TL-05 | Words after `.` or `\|` (optionally one whitespace) are names, including `is` / `is not` (level 3) | Upstream lexed `foo.and`, `x\|matches`, `foo.is` as operators | Twig 3.1.0, whitespace form 3.24.0 | `operators.twig` parity |
| TL-06 | Numbers with `_` separators and optionally signed exponents (level 3) | Upstream split `1_000` and `1e3` into a number and a name | Twig 3.17.0 | `numbers.twig` parity |
| TL-07 | Names may contain any character from U+007F upwards | PHP matches `\x7f-\xff` per byte, so any UTF-8 name is valid; upstream threw on `名前` | None (port fix) | `names.twig` parity |
| TL-08 | A backslash-escaped line break is allowed inside strings | PHP's `/s` flag lets `\\.` match a newline; JavaScript's `.` does not, so upstream threw | None (port fix) | `strings.twig` parity |
| TL-09 | Add a derived-and-modified notice to `Lexer.ts`, `Token.ts` and `TokenType.ts` | Apache-2.0 §4(b); applied last so it never shifts other patches | None (licence compliance) | `npm run vendor:check` |

Every shipped file except `SyntaxError.ts` is modified; `SyntaxError.ts` is
byte-identical to upstream and carries no notice.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run vendor:check` | Fails if `src/lexer` differs from pristine plus patches. |
| `npm run vendor:write` | Regenerates `src/lexer` from pristine plus patches. |
| `npm run test:upstream` | Runs upstream's tape tests against the patched sources. |
| `node scripts/vendor-twig-lexer.ts --workspace <dir>` | Creates a git workspace of pristine plus current patches for writing a new patch. |

## Adding or changing a patch

1. `node scripts/vendor-twig-lexer.ts --workspace /tmp/twig-lexer-ws`
2. Edit the files in the workspace.
3. Save `git -C /tmp/twig-lexer-ws diff` as `patches/TL-NN-short-name.patch`,
   prefixed with a DEP-3 header (copy one from an existing patch).
4. Add the file name to `patches/series` and a row to the table above.
5. `npm run vendor:write && npm run vendor:check && npm run test:upstream && npm test`

Never edit `src/lexer` directly: `npm run vendor:check` fails when it drifts
from pristine plus patches, so run it in CI.

## Re-syncing

- **A new twig-lexer release:** replace `pristine/` with the new revision,
  update the header above, then re-run the steps above. Drop patches that
  upstream now covers and refresh any that no longer apply.
- **A new Twig release:** compare Twig's lexer and operator list between the
  supported version and the new one, for example
  `git diff v3.28.0 v3.29.0 -- src/Lexer.php src/Extension/CoreExtension.php`
  in a Twig checkout, then add one patch per new behaviour.
